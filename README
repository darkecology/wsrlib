#This is the codebase for processing/visualizing the NEXRAD Radar Data
#testing mercurial instead of git from local (different machine)
#testing merge and pull
#testing again
If you are downloading this code base, you would need access to the data as well
Download the data (smaller test data set from) : /mnt/nfs/work1/sheldon/birdcast/radar_test_data
This is a test data set with just three scans and the associated wind files as well
The above data should be copied to a folder called 'data' in the cajun directory

After cloning this repository and adding data, you would need to recompile rsl2mat. 
The instructions for the same are in rsl2mat/README.txt

To avoid commiting rsl2mat and data to the repository everytime you commit, add the following to the .hgignore file
data/
rsl2mat/

Before running any of the code files, make sure all the data directories are given properly, and make sure to add those data directories to the .hgignore file to avoid commiting the data directories

An open list of issues/bugs is mentioned in open_list.txt
